## Overview of Experimental Folder

The samples within this folder contain **experimental** work.  These samples are meant to provide a means to solicite 
feedback on a given design, approach, or technology solution being considered by the Bot Framework Team.  

The samples within this folder **should not** be used in a production environment.  They are not supported and the team doesn't want to 
convey they a given approach will be integrated into a future version of the Bot Framework SDK.  To that end, we want to provide a 
way to engage on topics that can help guide our roadmap for future work.

## Goals of this work
The Bot Framework Team seeks feedback on a specific problem and possible solution that exists when developing bots using the Bot Framework SDK.

Each sample contains a backing GitHub issue that frames the problem and a bit about the approach.  Feedback on the sample should be added to the issue used to track the sample.  


## Resources
The samples found in this folder are experimental, are not necessary relate to one another, are stand-alone and are not meant to be viewed in any particular order.  None of the samples in the **experimental** folder should be used with bots running in a production envirnonment.
