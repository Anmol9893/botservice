Bot Framework v4 custom dialogs bot sample

This bot has been created using [Microsoft Bot Framework][1], it shows how to sub-class the `Dialog` class to create different bot control mechanism like simple slot filling.

BotFramework provides a built-in base class called `Dialog`. By subclassing `Dialog`, developers can create new ways to define and control dialog flows used by the bot.


## Prerequisites
- [Node.js][4] version 8.5 or higher
    ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```
>>>>>>> 9a1346f23e7379b539e9319c6886e3013dc05145

# To try this sample
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
<<<<<<< HEAD
- In a terminal, navigate to samples/javascript_nodejs/19.custom-dialogs
    ```bash
    cd samples/javascript_nodejs/19.custom-dialogs
    ```
- Install modules and start the bot
    ```bash
    npm i && npm start
    ```
    Alternatively you can also use nodemon via
    ```bash
    npm i && npm run watch
    ```

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is
a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost
or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator)

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator V4
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration and navigate to javascript_nodejs/21.custom-dialogs
- Select custom-dialogs.bot file

# Deploy this bot to Azure
You can use the [MSBot](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) Bot Builder CLI tool to clone and configure any services this sample depends on. 

To install all Bot Builder tools - 

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.5 or higher

```bash
npm i -g msbot chatdown ludown qnamaker luis-apis botdispatch luisgen
```

To clone this bot, run
```
msbot clone services -f deploymentScripts/msbotClone -n <BOT-NAME> -l <Azure-location> --subscriptionId <Azure-subscription-id>
```

# Custom Dialogs

BotBuilder provides a built-in base class called `Dialog`. By subclassing Dialog, developers
can create new ways to define and control dialog flows used by the bot. By adhering to the
features of this class, developers will create custom dialogs that can be used side-by-side
with other dialog types, as well as built-in or custom prompts.

This example demonstrates a custom Dialog class called `SlotFillingDialog`, which takes a
series of "slots" which define a value the bot needs to collect from the user, as well
as the prompt it should use. The bot will iterate through all of the slots until they are
all full, at which point the dialog completes.

- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/javascript_nodejs/19.custom-dialogs`
    ```bash
    cd samples/javascript_nodejs/19.custom-dialogs
    ```
- Install modules
    ```bash
    npm install

    ```

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator **v4**
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator][5] is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator version 4.2.0 or greater from [here][6]

## Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator **v4**
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration
- Navigate to `javascript_nodejs/21.custom-dialogs` folder
- Select `custom-dialogs.bot` file

# Deploy this bot to Azure
## Prerequisites
- [Azure Deployment Prerequisites][41]

## Provision a Bot with Azure Bot Service
After creating the bot and testing it locally, you can deploy it to Azure to make it accessible from anywhere.  To deploy your bot to Azure:

```bash
# login to Azure
az login
```

```bash
# set you Azure subscription
az account set --subscription "<azure-subscription>"
```

```bash
# provision Azure Bot Services resources to host your bot
msbot clone services --name "<your_bot_name>" --code-dir "." --location westus --sdkLanguage "Node" --folder deploymentScripts/msbotClone --verbose
```

### Publishing Changes to Azure Bot Service
As you make changes to your bot running locally, and want to deploy those change to Azure Bot Service, you can _publish_ those change using either `publish.cmd` if you are on Windows or `./publish` if you are on a non-Windows platform.  The following is an example of publishing

```bash
# run the publish helper (non-Windows) to update Azure Bot Service.  Use publish.cmd if running on Windows
./publish
```

### Getting Additional Help Deploying to Azure
To learn more about deploying a bot to Azure, see [Deploy your bot to Azure][40] for a complete list of deployment instructions.
